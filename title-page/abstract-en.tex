In the thesis we present a new implementation of Nussknacker's enricher named Prinz that is responsible for
Machine Learning models management and scoring. We describe the source of need for such implementation and
the background behind the Event Stream Processing approach. We show our approach to the process of developing
the open source library with API specification and our own API implementations including MLflow models
registry, PMML standard and H2O models registry. We describe the process towards managing open source project,
developers' environment management for the process of development and the decisions made to create our
implementation of Nussknackerâ€™s enricher. Additionally, we present our thoughts on the topic of each integration,
its development process and the final results of API implementation which includes additional assumptions made
during the deployment of integration. As a final result of our work with the project, we provide working
library sources with readable examples of its deployment to the Nussknacker environment.
