\subsection{Programming workflow}

Development processes in the project rely heavily on the features provided by GitHub\footnote{\href{https://github.com/}{https://github.com/}}, our repository host provider.

For each new issue, engineer creates a development branch. Branch names follow naming convention \texttt{username/feature-name}.
Developer uses this branch as a development area.
Once the feature is implemented, they create a pull request to the main project branch.

Pull request is a final stage before merging changes to the code base.
Its creation triggers a number of automated checks (called ''GitHub workflows'') to enforce code quality and reveal regressions.
Code quality evaluation includes simple checks (e.g. for extra white space) and static analysis tools like \texttt{scalastyle}.
Regression testing comprises unit tests of the project.

Other team members can review the code and request changes.
Developer usually pushes new commits with the updates (what in turn triggers workflows again).
They mark conversation as resolved and ask team members for approval.
With an approval and all checks passing, developer checks-in their code to the main branch.

Team introduced \texttt{dev/feature} branches at a later stage of the project.
These are dedicated for complex changes involving multiple contributors.
Pushing to \texttt{dev/feature} branches follows the same workflow.

\subsection{Other issues}

\paragraph{Protected branches.}
To prevent accidental changes, \texttt{master} branch was marked as protected.
This means that contributors can't push to \texttt{master} directly.
Also, pull requests require an approval and passing checks and cannot be merged otherwise.
The same rules apply to \texttt{dev/feature} branches.

\paragraph{Additional documentation.}
Project includes additional documentation served as a GitBook\footnote{\href{https://gitbook.com/}{https://gitbook.com/}} web page.
Manual pages are written in Markdown and stored along the code.
This approach allows to automate building and deploying HTML pages using existing solutions.
Choice of GitBook and its version follows on from the parent project.
